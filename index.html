<h1>To the girl, I love the most!!</h1>
<div>
<strong><em><p>I am so lucky to have you by my sideðŸ˜Š. Everything you do for me never goes unnoticed. I don't know what I did to deserve someone as wonderful as you, but I am eternally grateful to have your love, support, and affection. Thank you for being you, and for having me by your side.</p></em></strong>

<strong><em><p>Darling, itâ€™s safe to say you are my entire reason for being alive. Itâ€™s also safe to say that Iâ€™ve fallen deeply in love with you. After everything weâ€™ve been through, the demons weâ€™ve fought and the sadness weâ€™ve enduredâ€¦ weâ€™re still together. Everything weâ€™ve been through has made us stronger. We are unstoppable. Our love is too powerful and we can overcome anything.</p></em></strong>
<strong><em><p>I know I say I love you all the time, but thatâ€™s not enough. Those three words canâ€™t describe the way I feel about you. You make my tummy do flips and my hands shake. Iâ€™ve never loved anyone as much as I love you and I donâ€™t think I will ever love someone this much again. Youâ€™re everything I have ever wanted and needed. I am in love with you so much, youâ€™re my everything, my entire heart, my world.</p></em></strong>
<hr>
<strong><em><p>You are my strength. You are not only the sails that steer my ship, but you are also the waves below that carry me. Without you, I would cease to have a backbone, as you are the entire foundation holding me up. I could never think of a day where you are not with me. I imagine if that day came, I would become weak. I would crumble into a coward. But together we are strong. We are unstoppable. That is why I love you.</p></em></strong>

<strong><em><p>Whenever Iâ€™m with you, Iâ€™m different, but in a good way. I smile and laugh more, and I donâ€™t have to pretend that everything is okay. With you, I can drop the facade and just feel and express everything genuinely. I no longer feel hurt and alone and instead I feel safe and loved. Youâ€™re so easy to talk to, to open up to. And in turn, everything you say resonates with me like no other. You have showed me that in this world filled with apathy, there is one person who can love me for who I really am. I really appreciate you being here because with you, Iâ€™m different. With you, Iâ€™m happy.</p></em></strong>
<hr>
<strong><em><p>I hope you know how much you mean to me. You are such an important part of my life. In fact, you are the center of my life. Everything I do is for us and I hope you know that I am always trying to do the right thing that will make our relationship a stronger one. You have inspired me to be the best version of myself that I can possibly be and I hope that I can somehow repay you for everything that you have done for me. Without you, I would be a completely different person. You have taught me so much about life and because of you, I truly know what love is.</p></em></strong>
<strong><em><p>Even if I say â€˜I love youâ€™ to you a trillion times, it is simply not enough. Words are never enough to express what I feel for you. My feelings for you are just so amazing that it makes me high. It is just amazing to have you as my soul mate. You are my everything.</p></em></strong>
